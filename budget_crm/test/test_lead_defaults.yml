   I select for this file a user that is not admin
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_colette'

  I check that the Analytic Account comes from the lead's Team
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead = model.create(cr, uid, {'name': 'TTTT', "section_id": ref('sales_team.crm_case_section_1')}, context=context)
    lead = model.browse(cr, uid, lead, context=context)
    assert lead.analytic_account_id.id == ref('account.analytic_commercial_marketing'), "Analytic Account of the lead does not come automatically from the team of the lead"
